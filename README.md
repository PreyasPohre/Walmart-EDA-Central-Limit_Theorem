# Walmart - EDA - Confidence Interval - Central Limit Theorem

About Walmart
Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.

Business Problem
The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).

The Walmart sales and growth analysis project focuses on understanding customer purchase behavior with a particular emphasis on factors such as gender, age, and marital status. The primary goal is to gain insights into how these demographic variables influence the spending habits of Walmart customers.

The project involves a detailed examination of customer purchasing patterns, aiming to identify trends and preferences associated with different demographic groups. One specific aspect under investigation is the potential gender-based differences in spending habits. The analysis seeks to determine whether female customers tend to exhibit higher spending compared to their male counterparts.

To achieve these objectives, the project involves data collection and analysis, utilizing information from Walmart's sales records and customer databases. The findings from this analysis could provide valuable insights for Walmart to tailor its marketing strategies and product offerings to better meet the preferences and needs of specific customer segments, ultimately contributing to the overall sales growth of the company.
